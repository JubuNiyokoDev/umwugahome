/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for UmwugaHome Platform
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and associated data (artisans, training centers, youths, mentors).
 * Top-level collections such as `orders` are secured with checks against `customerId` and `artisanId`.
 * Public listing of artisans is permitted.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * Data is primarily nested under `/users/{userId}`, creating a clear ownership hierarchy.
 * Artisans, Training Centers, Youths, and Mentors are subcollections of `/users/{userId}`.
 * Products and Programs are subcollections of their respective owners (artisans and training centers).
 * Orders are stored in a top-level collection.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * User profiles and associated data are strictly private to the owning user.
 * Public listing of artisans is allowed.
 * Orders are accessible with authorization checks on customerId and artisanId.
 * Data validation is limited to ownership and relational integrity for rapid prototyping.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The data structure is designed to minimize the need for `get()` calls within security rules.  For example, the `Order` document contains both `artisanId` and `customerId`, allowing rules to validate access without needing to fetch related user or artisan documents.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * User-specific data is stored under the `/users/{userId}` path to ensure private access.
