/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for UmwugaHome Platform
 *
 * @description
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for most data,
 * with some collections (e.g., /artisans) potentially allowing public read access.
 * It leverages path-based authorization and data denormalization to minimize
 * the need for costly `get()` calls within the rules.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information; access is restricted to the user themselves.
 * - /users/{userId}/{profileType}: Subcollections for artisan, training center, youth, and mentor profiles,
 *   ensuring user-specific data isolation.
 * - /users/{userId}/artisan/products/{productId}: Stores products created by a specific artisan.
 * - /orders/{orderId}: Stores order information.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Public read access is granted to the /artisans collection, but write access is restricted to owners.
 * - All write operations (create, update, delete) require authentication.
 * - Data validation is minimal during this prototyping phase, focusing on authorization-critical fields.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `Order` entity contains `artisanId` and `customerId` to simplify access control for orders.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - User profiles and their associated data (artisans, training centers, etc.) are stored under the /users/{userId} path,
 *   while top-level collections like /artisans are used for data that may be publicly accessible.
